## Faulty Update of a QuinLED Controller

### The Situation

Normally, I can easily update my [QuinLED Dig Uno LED Controller](https://quinled.info/pre-assembled-quinled-dig-uno/) OTA (Over-the-Air) via Home Assistant. However, for some reason, the update from version 0.14.4 to 0.15.0 failed. Both the OTA update and the manual update via the WLED WebUI didnâ€™t work.

After extensive research in various Reddit posts and on GitHub, I finally found the right solution. I want to share it here to save you time and frustration.

### The Solution

1. **Create a Backup**: Before proceeding, be sure to back up your current settings (and presets). The following steps will **ERASE ALL** data as the ESP32 partition changes.
2. **Remove the ESP32**: On the Dig Uno, the USB port is blocked by a fuse. So, disconnect the power and simply lift the white board upwards. This is the ESP32. Only this part is needed. In my case, this was especially convenient because the rest of the controller was installed, and I didnâ€™t have to dismantle the entire QuinLED.
3. **Flash via USB**: Connect the ESP32 to your PC or Mac using a USB-C cable. Visit [install.quinled.info](https://install.quinled.info/) and flash your board. As of this postâ€™s date (January 13, 2025), the website only offers version 0.14.2. Proceed with the downgrade.
4. **Downgrade**: Flash your board with version 0.14.2, even if itâ€™s a downgrade. In my case, from 0.14.4 to 0.14.2, this worked without issues.
5. **Update to 0.15.0**: Afterward, you can update to the latest version with the new partition (see Additional Resources).
   - Download the latest WLED firmware for ESP32 from [Github: Aircoookie/WLED releases](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases) (e.g., `WLED_0.15.0_ESP32.bin`). Alternatively, thereâ€™s a customized QuinLED version available at [Github: intermittech/QuinLED-Firmware releases](https://github.com/intermittech/QuinLED-Firmware/releases).
   - Flash either via USB again or possibly OTA.

### After Flashing

- Connect to the board via Wi-Fi (SSID: `WLED-AP`, Password: `wled1234`). Or use this QR Code:

- Access the web interface via [http://4.3.2.1](http://4.3.2.1) and add your Wi-Fi settings under Config. Btw. iOS was switching back to my default Wifi, because "no Internet" - just keep that in mind if you're using your smartphone.
- Done. You can now reach the QuinLED on your regular Wi-Fi network.
