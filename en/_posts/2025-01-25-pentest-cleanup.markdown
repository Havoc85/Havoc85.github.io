An exciting discussion about penetration tests (pentests) and their aftermath recently took place on LinkedIn.  
A post by Marlon Hübner, a self-proclaimed "Cybersecurity Hero," described a situation in which a surveillance camera in the server room still had the pentester’s email address stored for forwarding images months after a pentest. These cameras were reportedly taken offline after a prior attack. The discovery led to criticism of the pentesters: they should have cleaned up after themselves and removed the email forwarding.

But is this expectation justified?  
And what conclusions can be drawn from various responses, including my own Mastodon poll?

### The LinkedIn Post: Many Open Questions

The [original post (LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marlon-hübner_vom-pentester-in-der-überwachungskamera-spuren-activity-7287461391454666754-vPlM/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) leaves many questions unanswered from a security perspective:

- **Was the email address still active?** Could the address still receive images, or was it, as is customary in our pentests, a temporary address used only for the duration of the project and automatically deactivated afterward?
- **How could the camera send emails in the first place?** Why was an internal device capable of sending emails to external addresses? Wouldn’t `webcam01`, which typically sends emails to `admin@customer.com` but suddenly starts sending to `pentester@anothercompany.com`, trigger alarms in a properly configured SIEM?
- **Were contractual details clear?** Did the agreement with the pentesters specify that artifacts should be removed after the test?
- **Was the issue mentioned in the report?** Pentesters who receive images from a server room usually highlight this as a critical finding in their pentest report. Was the client perhaps unclear about the wording or significance of the issue?

These and other details are critical to assessing the situation. However, they raise more questions about the client’s security architecture and post-pentest follow-up than about the pentesters’ work.

### The Mastodon Poll: Different Perspectives

This discussion inspired me to conduct a poll on Mastodon. The question was:

[_“Should pentesters clean up after themselves, e.g., delete accounts they created or remove email forwarding configurations?”_](https://infosec.exchange/@d33pjs/113868778914598033)

The responses from 22 participants were as follows:

- **64%:** Yes, they should absolutely clean up.
- **14%:** It depends...
- **9%:** No, their time should be spent finding security issues.
- **14%:** Decided case by case with the customer.

While the majority leaned toward a clear answer, the comments revealed that expectations of pentesters are often vague or vary greatly.

In hindsight, it would have been useful to know whether the respondents were pentesters themselves or customers. Additionally, a differently worded question, such as “What is your _default_ expectation of pentesters?” might have provided more precise insights.

### What Does the Community Say?

The discussion around the poll highlighted several key points:

**1. Clear contractual agreements are essential.**  
As [@bhhaskin](https://social.bitsofsimplicity.com/@bhhaskin/113869077917255563) and [@fthy](https://mastodon.green/@fthy/113882683107203840) emphasized, it is crucial to clarify before a pentest whether cleanup tasks are part of the service. Ambiguity in agreements leads to misunderstandings.

**2. Cleanup by pentesters carries risks.**  
I align more with the opinions of [@stemeerkat](https://cyberplace.social/@stemeerkat/113882266783611136) and [@FritzAdalis](https://infosec.exchange/@FritzAdalis/113868868640959271), who argue that pentesters should not clean up.

Here’s why:

- **Traceability suffers:** Artifacts like logs or test accounts are invaluable for understanding vulnerabilities and attacks. A well-written report, such as “The CCTV system was compromised – please investigate and fix,” is far more actionable than erasing evidence.
- **Lack of system knowledge:** Pentesters typically lack in-depth knowledge of the infrastructure compared to internal teams. This could result in incomplete or improper cleanup, creating new issues.

**3. Different types of pentests require different approaches.**  
As [@codeofamor](https://social.codeofamor.net/@codeofamor/113868841949265844) noted, the answer often depends on the type of pentest. For web applications, pentesters might work on temporary systems that can be wiped afterward. However, setting up entire infrastructures for internal pentests only to dismantle them later is often impractical.

### My View: Responsibility and Security Go Hand in Hand

**Pentests are not an all-inclusive service.** Their purpose is to identify and document vulnerabilities, not to leave systems “spotless.” Cleanup should be handled by personnel who are familiar with the infrastructure and understand the implications of their actions, especially concerning remediation and availability.

**Criticism misses the point.** The LinkedIn post misdirects attention:

- If a surveillance camera could send emails to external addresses, this points to issues in network configuration or monitoring.
- If pentest artifacts were still present months later, it suggests the recommendations in the pentest report were not implemented.

**A strong security culture is essential.** Companies must take pentests seriously, thoroughly review the reports, and prioritize actions. Critical vulnerabilities, such as compromised devices in a server room, should be addressed immediately—not months later.

### Conclusion: Take Pentests Seriously – and Take Responsibility

The expectation that pentesters should clean up after themselves is often unrealistic and potentially harmful. Cleanup should be entrusted to those who understand the systems and can ensure no vulnerabilities remain.

Clients should view pentests as an opportunity to improve security and carefully implement the recommendations. Clear communication, contractual clarity, and a robust security culture help avoid misunderstandings and misplaced blame.

Ultimately, security is a shared responsibility—not a solo effort by the pentester.
